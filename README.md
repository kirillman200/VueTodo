# Vue 3 Todo App

## Description

This code was completed **without** use of any AI, althouh I understand in real world development AI would be used to speed up the process and make development more effiecent sometimes

## My Approach

The idea was to create a todo app using Pinia (Vue 3's state management library, Vuex is outdated now) and simple Vue Router. Also I wanted to make some soft animations for adding / removing and modyfing todos. I also wanted to make it look nice and clean.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
